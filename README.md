# react-autocomplete
- On typing in the search input box, the search results list opens up. The search could be just a string matching search.
- The list of cards can be navigated through keyboard or mouse
- only one card should highlight at a time if both mouse and keyboard are used for navigation
- This behaviour is similar to how youtube search works
- When no search results are found, an empty card is displayed
- The card list would be scrollable
- The highlighted card (via keyboard/mouse) will scroll into view
